 /* To create a typography theme for your website based on “Nighthawks” by Edward Hopper, we can break down font families into categories that complement the color scheme and mood of the painting:

1. Serif Fonts (Classic & Elegant):

Since “Nighthawks” has a somber, timeless feel, serif fonts that carry a sense of tradition and sophistication would align well:

	•	Merriweather: A modern serif with a touch of warmth, perfect for headings.
	•	Playfair Display: Elegant and stylish, this would work beautifully for titles or large text elements.
	•	EB Garamond: A traditional serif that offers a more classic feel for body text, adding to the timeless atmosphere.

2. Sans-serif Fonts (Modern & Clean):

For readability and contrast, sans-serif fonts would work well to balance the more dramatic mood of “Nighthawks”:

	•	Roboto: A neutral and clean font that works well for body text or navigation menus.
	•	Lato: Slightly rounded sans-serif, offering a friendly yet professional look, suitable for both body text and subheadings.
	•	Montserrat: Geometric and modern, its clean lines would nicely complement the sharp architectural lines present in the painting.

3. Display Fonts (Artistic & Attention-grabbing):

To evoke the era and city feel that “Nighthawks” represents, more creative display fonts can be used sparingly for emphasis or quotes:

	•	Raleway: A modern sans-serif that feels elegant but simple—great for impactful sections.
	•	Bebas Neue: Bold and strong, this could evoke the boldness of neon signs or cityscape typography.

4. Handwritten/Script Fonts (Personal & Emotional):

Given the isolated and contemplative mood of the painting, incorporating a subtle handwritten font for quotes or small details can add warmth:

	•	Dancing Script: Casual and easygoing, it adds a human touch without feeling overly decorative.
	•	Pacifico: More playful, can be used in small doses for accents like a signature or call-to-action button.

Suggested Pairings:

	•	Headings: Playfair Display or Merriweather
	•	Body Text: Roboto, Lato, or EB Garamond
	•	Accents/Quotes: Pacifico or Bebas Neue

These font families together will reflect the elegance, simplicity, and subtle drama that mirror the atmosphere of “Nighthawks.” */
